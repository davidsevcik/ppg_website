            <p> 
                W. A. Mozart himself conducted the world premiere of his Don Giovanni in one of Prague’s 
                theatres in 1787. The Czech opera was also the most potent cultural expression of the 19th 
                century nationalist movement, which led to the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.

            <h3><a href="/theatre-tickets/black-light-theatre/">BLACK LIGHT THEATRE</a></h3>
            <p>The black light theatre is unique to Prague; it was invented here in the 1960´s. The black light 
            technique means that  actors dressed in black hold and move with various props, while they themselves 
            are not seen by the viewers against the black background. This way the requisites, things and objects 
            seem to move themselves. </p>
